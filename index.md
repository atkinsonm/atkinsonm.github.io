## Who am I?

My name is Michael Atkinson (formerly, Michael Meluso). I am a Senior Cloud Engineer at [JHC Technology, Inc.](http://jhctechnology.com), an AWS Premier Consulting Partner. Much of my work has been focused on modernizing government and commercial organiations by taking advantage of cloud technologies, specificially Amazon Web Services. I pride myself as a DevOps evangelist and always look for ways to improve software releases through Infrastructre as Code, automation, continuous testing, failing fast, and extracting as much information from the feedback loop that can be applied to future releases.

I've helped organizations save money by moving to the cloud and understanding cloud pricing and procurement. I've shortened software release time by employing DevOps principles. I've helped organizations do things in the cloud they could never do before by taking advantage of best-in-breed technology while implementing industry-leading principles and best practices.

When I'm not migrating and optimizing cloud workloads, I enjoy running with my 1 year old Australian Shepherd, playing RPG and racing video games, and voluneerting as an EMT and firefighter.
