My name is Michael Atkinson (formerly, Michael Meluso). I am a Systems Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS). I consider myself a DevOps evangelist and always look for ways to improve software releases through Infrastructure as Code, automation, continuous testing, failing fast, and extracting as much information from the feedback loop that can be applied to future releases.

I've helped organizations save money by moving to the cloud and understanding cloud pricing and procurement. I've shortened software release time by employing DevOps principles. I've helped organizations do things in the cloud they could never do before by taking advantage of best-in-breed technology while implementing industry-leading principles and best practices.

Outside of work, I enjoy agility training with my 2 Australian Shepherds, playing RPG and racing video games, and patronizing my local watering hole.
