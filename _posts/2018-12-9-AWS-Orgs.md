AWS Organizations is a great tool for managing multiple AWS accounts at scale, but there are a few dependencies and gotchas for implementing all of the services which may not be self-evident. This is a guide to AWS Organizations and related services.

# Definitions

- AWS Organizations
- "Full access mode"
- OU
- SCP

# Account tenancy

## Master account

Many of the services in this list must be administered from the organization's master account. In addition to being the top-level account, the organizations account has the special designation of being the billing account for all accounts below. It is important for organizations to understand that users in this account with billing visibility can see the billing for all linked accounts. Particularly when an AWS reseller is involved, it becomes imperative to secure the billing information contained in this account. The following is a list of services and features which can only be administered from the master account:

- AWS Single Sign-On
  - Also means that the underlying AWS Directory Service directory must live in the master account
- AWS CloudFormation StackSets when using OUs
  - A disappointing realization is that even with the administration that AWS Organizations provides, it is still necessary to set up each AWS account which will be used as a part of the StackSets deployment with the [execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html).
  - StackSets can still be created from non-master accounts if the execution role is set up to allow administration from that account, but must use account Ids and cannot use OUs.
